## Calculate physiologic characteristics of awake and anesthetized adults, children and infants

A variety of formulae are provided for estimation of physiologic
characteristics of infants, children, and adults. Calculations include:
body surface area, ideal weight, airway dead-space, the alveolar gas
equation, and GFR. Each formula is referenced to the original
publication. Future functions will cover more material with a focus on
anaesthesia, critical care and peri-operative medicine.

Functions are provided for estimation of a range of physiologic
characteristics of infant, child and adult humans.

  - Height, weight and fluid compartments.
  - Henderson-Hasslebalch
  - Alveolar gas equation
  - Airway dead-space

Each formula is referenced to the original publication. Warnings can be
given for estimation based on input data outside of normal ranges.
Future functions will cover more material with a focus on anaesthesia,
critical care and peri-operative medicine.

Contributions welcome.
