## Calculate physiological characteristics of adults and children

A variety of formulae are provided for estimation of physiologic
characteristics of infants, children, and adults. For example,
calculations of ideal weight, and the alveolar gas equation. Each
formula is referenced to the original publication. Future functions will
cover more material with a focus on anaesthesia, critical care and
peri-operative medicine.

Functions are provided for estimation of a range of physiologic
characteristics of infants, child and adult humans.

  - Height, weight and fluid compartments.
  - Henderson-Hasslebalch
  - Alveolar gas equation
  - Airway deadspace

Each formula is referenced to the original publication. Warnings can be
given for estimation based on input data outside of normal ranges.
Future functions will cover more material with a focus on anaesthesia,
critical care and peri-operative medicine.

Contributions welcome.
