Description: A variety of formulae are provided for estimation
    of physiologic characteristics of infants, children, and adults. For
    example, calculations of ideal weight, airway dead-space, and the
    alveolar gas equation.  Each formula is referenced to the original
    publication.  Future functions will cover more material with a focus
    on anaesthesia, critical care and peri-operative medicine.
