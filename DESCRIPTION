Description: A variety of formulae are provided for estimation
    of physiologic characteristics of infants, children, and adults. For
    example, calculations of body surface area, ideal weight, airway
    dead-space, and the alveolar gas equation.  Each formula is referenced
    to the original publication.  Future functions will cover more material
    with a focus on anaesthesia, critical care and peri-operative medicine.
