## Calculate physiologic characteristics of awake and anesthetized adults, children and infants

```{r pkgdesc, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
# This relies on having the package installed
cat(
  unclass(
    utils::packageDescription("physiology")
  )[["Description"]]
)
```

Functions are provided for estimation of a range of physiologic characteristics of infant, child and adult humans.

 - Height, weight and fluid compartments.
 - Henderson-Hasslebalch
 - Alveolar gas equation
 - Airway dead-space
 
Each formula is referenced to the original publication. Warnings can be given for
estimation based on input data outside of normal ranges. Future functions
will cover more material with a focus on anaesthesia, critical
care and peri-operative medicine.

Contributions welcome.
